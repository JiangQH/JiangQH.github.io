### [surface normal prediction from monocular image](https://github.com/JiangQH/surface_normal_prediction_use_DL)
Estimating surface normal from monocular image. Based on the deep learning library caffe with some modifications,
achieving state-of-art result, results and demo is shown on the github.


### [pixel wise info recovery from monocular image](https://github.com/JiangQH/DL_for_pixel-wise_classification)
A general frame work to predict pixel wise info from monocular image. When applying to depth estimation, it achieves state-of-art result with much less data, same with surface normal estimation, note segmentation can also be handdled with this project, which will be shown soon.


### [image style transfer](https://github.com/JiangQH/style_transfer)
Based on the feature of cnn, transfer the style from one image to another, which can be used to generate artistic life image.


### [carrie](https://github.com/JiangQH/carrie)
A self develop machine learning and deep learning library, used for learning and research.
