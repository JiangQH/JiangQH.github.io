### [Image/Video-Style-Transfer](https://github.com/JiangQH/Style-Transfer-In-Tensorflow)
Based on the feature of convolution networks, transfer the style from one image to another, which can be used to generate artistic images with our own content. With pretrained network, it can be done real time, and can do transfer to videos!   

### [Hypercolumns-Based-Surface-Normal-Recovery](https://github.com/JiangQH/Hypercolumns-Based-Surface-Normal-Recovery)
Estimating surface normal from monocular image. Based on the deep learning library caffe with some modifications, achieving state-of-art result, the demo is shown on the github.   


### [Monocular-Depth-Surface-Normal-Estimation](https://github.com/JiangQH/Monocular-Depth-Surface-Normal-Estimation)
A general frame work to predict pixel wise info from monocular image. When applied to depth estimation, it achieves state-of-art result with much less data, same with surface normal estimation. Note segmentation can also be handdled with this project, which will be shown soon.   

### [Dense-Pixel-Models-In-Tensorflow](https://github.com/JiangQH/Dense-Pixel-Models-In-Tensorflow)
Some state-of-art Dense Pixle Models implemented with tensorflow, many of them are trained for semantic segmentation originally, but can be extend to other subjets such as depth/normal estimation.  

### [carrie](https://github.com/JiangQH/carrie)
A self develop deep learning library, optimized for cpu use purpose, and with minimum dependency. During developing...
